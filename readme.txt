Hi Jacob

I hope this finds you well. Included is my project. Please use node index.js to run the file. 
You will be prompted to enter your number to convert to a string
I chose to write this in JavaScript because I believe full stack development
is heading closer and closer towards JavaScript; I believe JavaScript will be the 
primary programming language for web development this decade. 

I think it would be cool to have this deal with precision, since in any experiment
(and anything Oil and Gas measurement) we are concerned about precision. For this, 
I gave the greatest precision up to 12 decimal places. 

Limitations: 
1) Numbers must be less than 10 trillion 
2) Number precision must be greater than one ten trillionth
3) Currencies must be in U.S. Dollars
4) Export will not be capitalized, and is not hyphenated 

I hope you enjoy my solution as much as I enjoyed this project(:

With Gratitude,
Brennan Manion
